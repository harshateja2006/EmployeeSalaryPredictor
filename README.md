4. In-Depth Model Insights
The application includes several visualizations to understand the model's behavior:
Feature Importance: Shows the impact (coefficient) of each feature on the salary prediction.
Actual vs. Predicted Plot: A scatter plot to visualize the model's accuracy.
Residual Plot: Helps diagnose the variance of errors in the model.

Model & Performance
The prediction is powered by a Linear Regression model trained on key employee attributes. The model demonstrates high accuracy and reliability, as shown by the performance metrics below:
Metric	Value
R-squared (R²)	0.9685
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	5,913.58
Mean Squared Error (MSE)	56,695,101.59
An R² value of 0.9685 indicates that the model explains approximately 97% of the variance in the salary data, which is an excellent fit.
